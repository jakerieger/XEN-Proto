A highly-optimized 2D cross-platform game engine designed to allow rapid game development
with minimal boilerplate, while also producing efficiently-packed and lightweight distributables.

## What's included?

- OpenGL-based rendering engine
- Runtime game object and component system
- Multi-threading for audio, graphics, physics, and input contexts

- Custom memory management with detailed profiling for debugging and optimizing your game
- Asset packing tool for efficiently compressing and securing game asset files for distribution

## License

XEN has no license at the moment. Once I feel the project is ready to start accepting outside contributions,
a license will be attached. Until then, consider this project closed-source.
